# VirusShare



1. Started with "VirusShare.com" and download torrents of latest malware
2. This website has a list that matches the mimetypes with files "[https://a4lg.com/downloads/vxshare/index.en.html](https://a4lg.com/downloads/vxshare/index.en.html)"
3. Now I can create a list that will pull out the mimetypes that I will be looking for ou the json list like this "cat .\VirusShare\_00389.zip.file.json \| findstr 'application/msword' &gt;&gt; msword.json"
4. Next up is to compare the lists and pull out the files that match the Virus ID and then add the extension to the file.
5. Regex for removing everthing from VirusShare to end quot for exmapl "VirusShare\_ff348745" will match this regex VirusShare\(?:\*\)
6. Created a powershell script that does the following 1. removes the extra garbage from the json file that contains the full mimetype 2. loops through and extracts \(had to use 7zip cli\) each file and gives it a random name that can be referenced from another list
